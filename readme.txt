### WooCommerce Wholesale User Roles 

Want to manage your B2B users effectively? WholesaleX allows you to create as many wholesale user roles as you want to assign multiple users to the roles to facilitate them with offerings and restrict them with conditions. 

### WooCommerce Wholesale Registration Form Builder

WholesaleX also lets you create a custom registration form with desired custom fields. So that you can make a separate registration & login page for the B2B users, and once someone completes registration, you can assign them to desired user roles automatically or manually.

### WooCommerce Wholesale Bulk Order Form

The Bulk Bulk Order Form feature allows you to create a wholesale area exclusively for B2B users. So, wholesale customers can order products in bulk or create & save purchase lists to order them later. The bulk order form can be enabled on the customer's "My Account Page," or you can also create a separate bulk order page via shortcode.

### Private Store and WooCommerce Product Visibility Control

WholesaleX also allows you to hide your Wholesale store from guests and B2C users like an ideal WooCommerce Private store plugin. Either you can completely hide your entire store, or you can also hide the prices and encourage potential B2B users with the login message to view prices.

### Conversation

Want to stay connected with the users? Guess what? WholesaleX has a built-in conversation system that can be added to the customer's "My Account Page." So they can send general queries to start communicating with the site's admin.

### WooCommerce Request a Quote

WooCommerce Request a Quote is an exciting feature of the built-in conversation system of WholesaleX. So when the customers add any products to the cart, they will see a "Request a Quote" button. And when the potential customer sends any quote request, the store admin can negotiate with the buyer by sending a custom offer.

### WholesaleX Wallet

WholesaleX also has a digital wallet system that can be used as a payment method. Customers can add funds to their wallets and then use them while purchasing products from your store. And as a store admin can also manually add funds to any registered customer's wallet.

### Subaccounts 

This feature allows the registered B2B customer to create subaccounts. So the subaccounts holder can place orders on behalf of the main account holder. The main account holder provides desired permission to subaccount holders to control what they can do and what they cannot.
